Code to reproduce Atari experiments. See run_atari.py for the main loop of the algorithm, run_test.py for the testing procedure.
The file configs.py contains command line parser, and is set up with defaults corresponding to the arguments used to generate results in paper.
Main other files of interest may be losses_functional.py, where our loss is defined, models/architectures.py where you can see our model.
